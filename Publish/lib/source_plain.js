To ensure a steady supply, Bracco has implemented a new ordering process. Please review the letter for more details.   \nUPDATE 5/13: \nHealthTrust has been notified that there is a significant shortage of GE Omnipaque radiographic contrast media due to production limitations at GEs Shanghai facility, resulting from the COVID lock-downs. While GE is not a contracted supplier in this category, we know that some members still utilize GE. GE customers are currently on product allocations. Bracco is the HealthTrust contracted supplier for Radiographic Contrast Media. Bracco has confirmed that they will continue to supply HealthTrust committed customers with their historical usage of radiographic contrast media. Bracco is evaluating how they may support other HealthTrust members affected by the GE supply disruption. To ensure no disruption or delay in on-going orders, please refrain from ordering in large excess of current utilization in an effort to stock up against the risk of no future supply. Doing so may delay timing of processing the order as Bracco validates against past usage.

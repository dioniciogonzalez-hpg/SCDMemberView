of Omicron on the Fresenius Kabi labor force, which kept capacity in December at 67%. Fresenius Kabi
has improved capacity since December to 83% by hiring more people (26 added to the line), increasing
incentives, and reducing turnover and absenteeism in their Puerto Rico manufacturing plant.","Labor Shortages, Manufacturing Delays from Third Party Vendor","Member Communication, Clinical Alternatives","?Award SummaryClinical Resource - AABB Extending B?lood Supply TipsClinical Resource - Blood Conservation","?No cross posted","??Please refer to letter for additional information, and to resources around blood conservation strategies."

Cardinal is experiencing manufacturing delays due to a packaging raw material shortage. Production continues but at a lower rate. As packaging raw material allocation improves, Cardinal will increase production. You may experience rolling backorders.

Sterile saline and sterile water: 
Cardinal is experiencing delays due to sterilization capacity constraints. Sterilizer capacity has been impacted by broader global capacity constraints and increased demand, ultimately resulting in increased lead times. Production of irrigating solutions continues but is delayed due to a backlog at the sterilizer. You may experience rolling backorders. 

Mucus specimen traps/containers:
Cardinal is changing the supplier and production location for its ARGYLE? Mucus Traps and Specimen Containers. There will be rolling backorders and stock-outs during this transition period.
